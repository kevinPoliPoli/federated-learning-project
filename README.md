# Advanced Machine Learning - Federated learning exam project

This repository contains some jupiter notebooks to issue the following problems:
1) resnet20_centralized: training of a custom resnet20 based on group normalization layers
2) gradient_inversion_attack: simulation of one of the possible attacks that is possible to do in a distribuited learning scenario
